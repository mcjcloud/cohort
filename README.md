## Cohort
As we move closer to a socially distanced education, there is no great way for students to learn about upcoming events at their school or university. Where traditional event promotion (passing out flyers, making public announcements) fails, Cohort thrives by providing a one-stop-shop for student run organizations to reach the masses and students to stay up to date on activity at their school. 

With Cohort, faculty and student leaders can create events specifying dates, location (in-person or virtual), schedules, and more. Students can find these events without difficulty on our web application and with faculty promotion during student orientations, Cohort will quickly become Event Central!  

Cohort provides a few key benefits over its competitors. While products like OrgSync, CampusLabs, and EventBrite exist, they all fail to provide a pleasant and intuitive experience aimed directly at organizers and students. Both OrgSync and CampusLabs are aimed toward students, but neither is pleasant for organizers to use while EventBrite is not made specifically for students at all.
